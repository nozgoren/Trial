## The image data of the study was separated into different folders due to the upload limit
## Extract inboundVelocity01_Part1 and inboundVelocity01_Part2, merge them under one folder

## The images are digitised when you enter the file path in the code "in image_processing.py"

Please follow the following instructions for data processing

1. Run the "image_processing.py"
# Reads the images in the folder containing video images (e.g: 4.1, 4.2, etc.)
# Open "image_processing.py", navigate to line 14, and specify the file path to read images from the folder named "images".
# Go to line 15 and change the file name
# Go to line 40 and 41, set the minimum and maximum diameter of the ball
# Outputs "...digi.txt" file containing 2D coordinates of the geometric centre and boundaries of the ball 

2. Run "filtering_program_butterworth.py"
# Reads "...digi.txt" file
# Apply butterworth filter
# Outputs "...filtre.txt" file containing filtered 2D coordinates of the geometric centre and boundaries of the ball
